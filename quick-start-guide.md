# Quick Start Guide

Collateral onboarding applications in MakerDAO are of two main types based on the nature of the collateral being onboarded: Crypto native or Real World Asset collateral types.

1. Start by filling out the [MIP6 Collateral Application Template](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP6/MIP6c2-Collateral-Application-Template.md)
   1. For crypto native collateral (ERC20-like tokens with on-chain price feeds) make sure to review and comply, as much as possible, with the criteria defined in the [MIP6 Recommended Guideline Metrics for Onchain Collateral Onboarding ](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-recommended-guideline-metrics-for-onchain-collateral-onboarding/14503)
   2. For Real World Assets (RWA) make sure to review and comply with [MIP67: Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP67). Only in the case of RWA, to ensure application quality, it is strongly recommended to contact the [Real World Finance Core Unit (RWF CU) prio](resources/core-units-contacts.md)r to publishing the application.
2. Publish the Collateral Onboarding Application in the "[Collateral Onboarding](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/collateral-onboarding/27)" category in the Maker forum.

For a deeper understanding of the application process, please [read along](introduction-to-collateral-onboarding/high-level-overview-of-the-collateral-onboarding-process.md).
