# Introduction to MakerDAO Collateral Onboarding

## **Introduction and Motivation**

This handbook contains a thorough collection of information regarding Maker Protocol collateral onboarding, ranging from the formation of domain teams and the explanations of the governance processes involved to the domain work necessary for successful collateral onboarding used to date for successful collateral onboarding, and more.

Many of the collateral onboarding procedures described here emerged organically as the Protocol matured over the last year. Given the difficulty in parsing the various available materials and understanding how to onboard an asset from A to Z, the MakerDAO community and project teams seeking to onboard collateral may find the process frustrating and cumbersome without a clear primer. Therefore, to smooth MakerDAO’s journey to complete decentralization, the domain teams and the Maker Foundation have synthesized the collateral onboarding processes into this series of “first-cut” guides.

As the DAO expands and the Foundation recedes, this handbook will serve as a versatile tool, ever-evolving and ultimately molded by Community members to fit Community needs.

### **The Purpose of Collateral Within the Maker Protocol**

* **Increase Market Usage and Dai Demand:** The inclusion of diverse and desirable collateral types in the Maker Protocol increases market usage and, ultimately, the demand for the Dai stablecoin.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Adding collateral assets to the Maker Protocol diversifies the collateral portfolio, reducing the portfolio risk inherent in relying heavily on a single collateral type and helping to maintain the stability of Dai.
* **Scaling:** Diversification also enables the Maker Protocol to scale-up Dai supply.
