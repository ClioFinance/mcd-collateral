## 1. Introduction

The Collateral Onboarding initiative seeks to incentivize and reward contributors who coordinate around a directed objective: successfully onboard reliable and diverse collateral. 

Initially, funds will be allocated in the form of grants centered around defined milestones. 

## **2. Collateral Onboarding Grant V1**

The initial grant runs from September 18, 2020, to November 30, 2020, with the goal to achieve 250-500 million Dai supply from new collateral types.

The Collateral Onboarding Grant funds community members interested in working on this initiative. It also provides a special incentive \(and largest grant to date\) for rewarding collective collaboration:

* In addition to receiving a grant for outlined work, a grant incentive of 75,000 Dai \(split amongst participating grantees and domain teams working on collateral onboarding\) will be released at a 250 million Dai milestone, with a second additional fund release of 100,000 Dai at the 500 million Dai milestone. See details in the [original Maker Forum post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/collateral-onboarding-grants/4252), and feel free to ask questions.

## **3. Initial Grant Funding Collaborative Structure** 

Below are step-by-step instructions on how to apply for a grant and collaborate with individuals and domain teams.

### **Apply for a Grant**

**1. Choose a domain related to your expertise:** Community members can contribute to any domain appropriate to their skillset\(s\) \(e.g., Smart Contracts, Risk, Oracles, Legal, Project Management, Partnerships, Communications\). If a domain related to a specific area of expertise does not yet exist, contributors are encouraged to reach out to Amy Jung, Grants Coordinator \(@amy.jung on [MakerDAO Rocket.chat channel](https://chat.makerdao.com/)\).   

**2. Choose a contribution role type:**

* **Domain Contributor:** An individual who can contribute generally to a domain. \(Hourly rate of 60 Dai.\)
* **Collateral Assessment Contributor:** An individual or team interested in leading or supporting collateral assessments. \(The proposal is per collateral assessment\)
* **Project Consultant \(Independent or Team\):** A self-directed individual or team interested in bringing a specialized skill set such as on-chain data analytics. \(Grantee is expected to propose the scope.\)

3. **Deliver your application.** Send the info outlined above, along with a relevant CV, portfolio of work, or Github URL, to Amy Jung, Grants Coordinator \(@amy.jung on [MakerDAO Rocket.chat channel](https://chat.makerdao.com/)\).   

## **4. Get Started Once Approved**

4. **Connect with the Domain Facilitator:** Domain Facilitators provide contributors with an overview of work to be done. For example; 

* Collateral onboarding assessments for domains \(Risk, Smart Contracts, Oracles, Legal\)
* Development work for Smart Contracts and Oracles
* Domain team MIP and communications support
* Collateral prioritization framework development
* Collateral partner communication and management

5. **Start Work:** Clear communication with Domain Facilitators is expected all along the way. This includes but is not limited to weekly updates/syncs to discuss progress.

**6. Work Submission:** Domain Facilitators will confirm work completion for grant payout, while grantees produce an overview or template of learned processes to further promote community domain knowledge sharing.
